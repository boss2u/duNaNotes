UI of project written
going to sleep at 03:35 AM 6/5/2016
Today: 24/8/2016. I am focusing on the menus
Today:  6/9/2016. Redesigning the App totally.
                Instead of using a qtextedit as the page object, a qscrollarea will be used.
                Reason for this  is that since the page object will only provide scrolling operations
                It makes sense to use a scroll area instead of a textedit that will not be used for editing operations.
                Gradually moving each class to a its own file
Today: 5/10/2016. Just looking at the code in a computer center. I am currently printing my project.
                Just looking at this to kill time.
Today : 8/10/2016. I have broken the project down to meaningful files
                Things now look more interesting than before
                It doesn't give me headaches anymore.
                I have created the view, model and the middle man (what some call presenter, controller or viewModel)
                 The middle man sits between the view and the model
                 So, the view does not know about the model and vice versa
